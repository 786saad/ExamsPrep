To access a sqlite-copy of the data set specified in the SQL exercises `DB Browser for SQLite` is required. 
Open `File > Open Database` (make sure all file types are set to visible in the selection dialog)  and select the desired database 
file contained in the `Datenbank` folder of each semester's directory.

Since there aren't any sample solutions for these three subjects, we will simply make our own.

Solutions:
	--- can be as Textfile, PDF, Scanned, Picture from Mobie, anything is fine as long its readable

Adding a Solution F to a Task which has already a Solution G:
	 --- Compare your Solution F with Solution G :
		-- if it is equal, then no need to push it

		-- if its not equal, but you believe your solution is not wrong, make an issue:
			--"Fach: AnotherSolution: SS17/A1, (Solution F) by UserX and (Solution G) by UserY"
		

Problems with a Solution:
	-- Make an Issue ex.: "Fach: Problem: SS17/A1/solution by UserX", and write if you believe that you found a mistake in it

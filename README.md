Adding a Solution F to a Task which has already a Solution G:
	 --- Compare your Solution F with Solution G :
		-- if it is equal, then no need to push it

		-- if its not equal, but you believe your solution is not wrong, make an issue:
			--"AnotherSolution: SS17/A1, (Solution F) by UserX and (Solution G) by UserY"
		

Problems with a Solution:
	-- Make an Issue ex.: "Problem: SS17/A1/solution by UserX", and write if you believe that you found a mistake in it
